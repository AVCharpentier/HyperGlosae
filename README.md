# HyperGlosae: A Nelsonian[^1] hypertext infrastructure for digital humanities

## Vision

[Hypertexts as envisioned by Theodor Nelson in the 1960's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMKy52Intac) are "needed more than ever", hypertexts with links that can be:

- followed both ways (e.g. from a comment to the original and from the original to comments),
- created freely by any reader (without validation by the author or the organization hosting the original document),
- used to read linked documents side by side, with related fragments in parallel,
- used to quote, explain, translate an existing document or fragment in a new one, or to compare two existing documents.

Because of the Web scale and because of the gap between Web usage and the tradition of Humanities that inspired Theodor Nelson, rebuilding the Web on these bases are probably out of reach for most of people and organizations.
However, existing communities of "humanists" share the same epistemological and methodological tradition.
We think they are both willing and able to adopt such an infrastructure.

## Scope

Step by step, we will prototype such an infrastructure and will test it on prior documented practices of "parallel documents" in our existing Hypertopic software suite (esp. [TraduXio](https://hypertopic.org/traduxio) and [Cassandre](https://hypertopic.org/cassandre)).

## Deliverables

The folders of the repository will correspond to the main deliverables:

- `samples` of parallel documents, meaningful for stakeholders of our existing software,
- `features` specification through usage scenarios,
- `frontend` prototype for reading and writing parallel documents,
- `backend` prototype for storing parallel documents,
- `library` of reusable parts to be integrated in other frontends.
