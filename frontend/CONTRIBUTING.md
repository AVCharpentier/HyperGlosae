# Testing and developping Hyperglosae frontend

## Development mode

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you update code in `src`.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

The frontend is coded in JavaScript with the React framework (see [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)).

## Pre-production mode

```
npm run build
npm run preprod
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
